# ps5bot

ps5bot is an auto-checkout bot to purchase a PlayStation 5 from direct.playstation.com. I chose this site since I'm assuming BestBuy, Walmart, GameStop, Amazon, and Target are more mainstream sites to purchase electronics.

## Setup Instructions

 1. Install Node.js
 2. Install dependencies
 3. make CLI callable
    `yarn link`  
 4. run ps5bot. You'll be prompted to fill in required checkout info
    `ps5bot`  
    **Note: Below steps are still TODO**  
 5. set schedule for scraper to run
    `ps5bot schedule`  
 6. Run ps5bot around the time scheduled
    `ps5bot run`
Make sure to run this script and keep the terminal open around the time of the schedule
